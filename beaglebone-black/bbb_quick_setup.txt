step 1

Follow instruction at http://elinux.org/BeagleBoardUbuntu to create your sd card image for the beaglebone-black. (the following uses the latest stable 13.10 saucy)

step 2 :

open boot/uEnv.txt and uncomment the line 

#optargs=capemgr.disable_partno=BB-BONELT-HDMI,BB-BONELT-HDMIN,BB-BONE-EMMC-2G

if you want to keep HDMI without audio, you can remove the "BB-BONELT-HDMIN" from this line. Using the logibone disable the use of audio (will be fixed in a later sdk revision).

step 3 :

boot the beaglebone-black and then connect to 192.168.7.2 (if using usb connection otherwise resolve the IP address)

ssh ubuntu@192.168.7.2


Using an existing module compiled for the default Ubuntu image

downaload the module and files for your Ubuntu distribution, if you don't find your distribution or the module does not work, contact support@valentfx.com



Installing the compile infrastructure for the kernel module :

step 1 (On your Linux PC):

clone the linux-dev repository and move to the beaglebone branch :

git clone git://github.com/RobertCNelson/linux-dev.git
cd linux-dev
git checkout origin/am33x-v3.8 -b tmp

verify on http://elinux.org/BeagleBoardUbuntu what kernel version your kernel uses and modify version.sh accordingly :
ex for saucy 13.10 =>  BeagleBone/BeagleBone Black: v3.8.13-bone40 kernel 

KERNEL_REL=3.8
KERNEL_TAG=${KERNEL_REL}.13
BUILD=bone40

build the base kernel (may take a few hours depending on your internet connection and PC performances):

./build_kernel.sh


step 2 (On your Linux PC):

clone the logi-kernel repository on your computer :

git clone https://github.com/fpga-logi-dev/logi-kernel.git

go into the beaglebone-black folder and run build_module.sh with the linux-dev path as argument. 
If your board release is different than R1, open the build_module.sh and modify the BOARD_REV variable (ex : BOARD_REV=RA2) before running build_module.

./build_module ~/development/KERNEL/ARM/beaglebone-black/linux-dev-13_10/


copy the generated deploy directory onto your beaglebone home directory


step 3 (On the beaglebone black): 

connect to the beaglebone black over ssh and install an unpgraded version of dtc, this requires an internet connection for the beaglebone and may take some time:

wget -c https://raw.github.com/RobertCNelson/tools/master/pkgs/dtc.sh
chmod +x dtc.sh
./dtc.sh


step 4 (On the beaglebone black): go to the copied deploy directory and execute the setup_device_tree_R1.sh script (will load the device tree configuration file and load the kernel module)

step 6 (On the beaglebone black): Try to load the blink_led demo app using the following command:

sudo dd id=blink_led.bit of=/dev/logibone bs=4M

step 7 (On the beaglebone black):

lcone the logi-tools repository :
git clone https://github.com/fpga-logi-dev/logi-tools.git

Open the logibone_loader folder and execute install.sh as sudo.
sudo ./install.sh

try to load the blink_led application using logi_loader

sudo logi_loader blink_led.bit
